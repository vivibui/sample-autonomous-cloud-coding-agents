/**
 * Child-task release for orchestration.
 *
 * The single path that turns an orchestration child row into a running
 * ABCA task. Used in two places:
 *   - seed time (the webhook processor / discovery): release the root
 *     children (layer 0) so the graph starts.
 *   - reconcile time (the TaskTable-stream reconciler): release children
 *     whose predecessors just all succeeded.
 *
 * Each release:
 *   1. createTaskCore(...) with channelSource 'linear' + orchestration
 *      metadata, idempotency-keyed on ``orchestration_id#sub_issue_id``
 *      so a duplicate stream event / webhook replay never double-creates.
 *   2. on 201, conditionally flip the row child_status blocked|ready →
 *      released and stamp child_task_id (the GSI then resolves the
 *      task back to its row on the child's terminal event).
 *
 * The conditional update (``child_status IN (blocked, ready)``) is the
 * second idempotency guard: if two reconcile invocations race the same
 * release, only one wins the status flip; createTaskCore's own
 * idempotency key means the loser doesn't create a second task either.
