/**
 * Terminal TaskTable reconciler for budget rollups and dependency graphs.
 *
 * Consumes the **TaskTable DynamoDB stream**. For graph tasks it first:
 *   1. resolves the task's orchestration via the ChildTaskIndex GSI
 *      (skips non-orchestration tasks — they have no orchestration_id),
 *   2. loads the orchestration snapshot,
 *   3. computes the gating plan (pure: orchestration-reconcile.ts),
 *   4. persists child-status updates and releases newly-unblocked
 *      children via the shared release helper.
 * It then applies an idempotent user/team monthly cost rollup.
 *
 * Idempotent: budget rollups use a task marker, status updates are conditional,
 * and releaseChild is idempotency-keyed. Replayed terminal events neither
 * double-count spend, double-release children, nor regress state.
 *
 * Orchestration runs first so a budget-table outage cannot strand a dependency
 * graph. Released children can therefore be admitted against spend that excludes
 * the just-finished parent, allowing at most one dependency wave of overshoot.
