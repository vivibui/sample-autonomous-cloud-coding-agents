# Cross-language constants

`constants.json` is the single source of truth for numeric/textual
constants that must agree across Python (agent runtime), TypeScript
(CDK synth + CLI), and tests. Hard-coding the same value in three
places is how the `APPROVAL_GATE_CAP` triplication crept in (S9 in
PR #88's review); this file replaces that pattern.

**Design reference:** PR #88 design discussion thread
([issuecomment-4463943269](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents/pull/88))
— Option C.

## Why this lives in `contracts/`

Same rationale as `cedar-parity/`: neither `agent/` nor `cdk/` owns
the contract. This is the neutral location both runtimes read.

## Consumers

| Caller | Path | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `agent/src/shared_constants.py` | `/app/contracts/constants.json` | import-time |
| `agent/src/policy.py`, `agent/src/jira_reactions.py` | `SHARED_CONSTANTS` | import-time |
| `agent/src/server.py` | `SHARED_CONSTANTS["microvm_platform_config"]`, `SHARED_CONSTANTS["microvm_hook_budgets"]` | import-time |
| `cdk/src/handlers/shared/types.ts`, `jira-app-actor.ts` | `../../../../contracts/constants.json` | synth-time `import` |
| `cdk/src/handlers/shared/strategies/lambda-microvm-strategy.ts` | `microvm_platform_config` | synth-time `import`, read per session start |
| `cdk/src/constructs/lambda-microvm-compute.ts` | `microvm_hook_budgets` | synth-time `import` |
| `cdk/src/constructs/blueprint.ts` | re-exports from `types.ts` | synth-time |
| `cli/test/constants-parity.test.ts` | package-safe literal parity | test-time |

The agent reads at runtime via `Path(__file__) / "../../contracts/..."`
in dev / `/app/contracts/...` in the deployed image (the Dockerfile
copies `contracts/` to `/app/contracts/`). The CDK side imports the
JSON at TypeScript compile time via `resolveJsonModule`.

```

- **`approval_gate_cap.min`** — minimum acceptable bound on a blueprint's
  approval gate cap. Floor: 1 (zero would disable the gate, which the
  three-outcome Cedar model relies on).
- **`approval_gate_cap.max`** — maximum acceptable bound. Ceiling: 500
  (PolicyEngine performance falls off above this; tested to 1k but not
  validated in production).
- **`approval_gate_cap.default`** — value applied when a blueprint omits
  the field. 50 is the design-decision default (see
  `docs/design/CEDAR_HITL_GATES.md` decision #13).
- **`approval_timeout_s.min`** — floor for `approval_timeout_s` (§6
  decision #6). 30 seconds — below this, humans cannot realistically
  respond to an approval prompt.
- **`approval_timeout_s.max`** — absolute ceiling for `approval_timeout_s`
  before the `maxLifetime - 300` clip is applied (§7.3). 3600 seconds
  (1 hour).
- **`approval_timeout_s.default`** — value applied when the submit payload
  omits `approval_timeout_s`. 300 seconds (5 minutes) per §6 decision #6.
- **`max_budget_usd.min`** — floor for a task's `max_budget_usd` (1 cent).
  Validated server-side (`validation.ts`) and pre-validated by
  `bgagent submit --max-budget` (#258).
- **`max_budget_usd.max`** — ceiling for `max_budget_usd` ($100). Same
  two consumers as `min`.
- **`monthly_budgets`** — the DynamoDB key prefixes, config index, rollup
  retention, alert thresholds, and claim-marker names shared by the CDK
  admission/rollup path and the operator CLI. CDK reads this object directly.
  The published CLI mirrors it as literals and its constants-parity test makes
  drift a CI failure.
- **`jira_app_actor.min_secret_length`** — minimum HMAC shared-secret length
  accepted by the agent, CDK, and CLI Jira app-actor clients.
- **`jira_app_actor.forge_webtrigger_suffix`** — hostname suffix required by
  app-actor proxy URL validation to prevent operator-supplied SSRF targets.
- **`microvm_platform_config.env_by_key`** — the Lambda MicroVMs `platform_config`
  allowlist (ADR-021 P2): each wire key (snake_case) mapped to the environment
  variable the agent installs it as (UPPER_SNAKE). This block is unlike the
  others — it is a **security allowlist**, not a tuning bound. The MicroVM image
  is a snapshot whose env is frozen at build time, so the agent's non-secret
  platform env arrives in the `/run` hook payload instead; the values land in
  `os.environ`, which makes an unrecognised key an env-injection attempt. The
  consumer (`agent/src/server.py`) therefore **rejects** any `platform_config`
  carrying a key that is not in this map. Values are non-secret identifiers
  (table/bucket names, secret ARNs, role ARNs) only.
- **`microvm_platform_config.required`** — the subset without which a task cannot
  run (task + event tables, GitHub secret ARN, session role ARN). A `/run` hook
  whose `platform_config` misses or blanks any of these is rejected with HTTP 400.
- **`microvm_platform_config.arn_keys`** — the subset of `env_by_key` whose VALUES
  are ARNs, and which the agent therefore checks for partition/account agreement
  before installing. The key allowlist stops a payload setting an unrecognised
  variable; it does not stop a payload pointing an **allowlisted** key at a
  different resource, and `github_token_secret_arn` is fetched with the unscoped
  execution role and cached into `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Any value that is malformed, or
  that disagrees with the anchor below on partition or account, is rejected
  (HTTP 400 `MICROVM_RUN_PLATFORM_CONFIG_INVALID`). This is **fail-fast plus
  defence in depth, not an ownership proof** — the account-scoped IAM grants are
  what actually deny a foreign read, and an in-account redirect is deliberately
  *not* covered (see `MICROVM_PLATFORM_CONFIG_ARN_KEYS` in
  `agent/src/server.py` for the full statement of what this does and does not buy).
- **`microvm_platform_config.account_anchor_key`** — which `arn_keys` entry supplies
  the expected partition + account. Must be `agent_session_role_arn`-shaped: a
  payload key rather than `os.environ` or an `sts:GetCallerIdentity`, because the
  environment is empty by construction on this backend (the snapshot bakes nothing)
  and this check runs on the path that must make zero AWS calls beyond the S3
  payload fetch. Two invariants follow and both are enforced: the anchor must be in
  `arn_keys`, **and** it must be in `required` — an optional anchor would let a
  payload disarm the whole check by simply omitting it.

All four `microvm_platform_config` fields are validated for shape (snake_case keys,
UPPER_SNAKE unique env names, `required ⊆ env_by_key`, `arn_keys ⊆ env_by_key`
non-empty, `account_anchor_key ∈ arn_keys ∩ required`) by
`scripts/check-constants-sync.ts` **and** by `agent/src/server.py` at import time,
so a malformed contract fails the drift check *and* the MicroVM image build. The
duplication is deliberate: a malformed entry here would silently **widen** what the
agent accepts from a network payload, so neither side is trusted to be the only
gate.

- **`microvm_hook_budgets.ready_hook_timeout_seconds`** — the `/ready` build-hook
  budget the CDK construct declares to `CreateMicrovmImage`
  (`READY_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` in `cdk/src/constructs/lambda-microvm-compute.ts`).
  300 s, not 60 s, because as of ADR-021 P2-F5 `/ready` does real work: it warms the
  225 MiB `claude` binary so its pages are resident when the snapshot is taken.
- **`microvm_hook_budgets.warmup_total_budget_seconds`** — the agent's ceiling for
  the WHOLE `/ready` warm-up (`_READY_WARMUP_TOTAL_BUDGET_SECONDS` in
  `agent/src/server.py`): required command plus every best-effort one, which share
  the remainder rather than each getting a fresh budget.
- **`microvm_hook_budgets.warmup_required_timeout_seconds`** — the required
  warm-up's own slice (`_READY_WARMUP_REQUIRED_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`). Generous on
  purpose: a cold 225 MiB `exec` has no predictable duration, which is the lesson of
  P2-F5.

Unlike every other block here, these three are not independent tuning bounds — they
are a **relationship**: `warmup_required < warmup_total < ready_hook`. The warm-up
must finish inside the budget the service holds the hook to, or a fix for a runtime
failure turns into a build failure. A relationship cannot be enforced from one side,
which is why both halves live in the contract even though each has a single
consumer. `scripts/check-constants-sync.ts` asserts the ordering and rejects a
literal re-declaration on **either** side — the Python constants *and*
`READY_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` in the TypeScript construct — and
`agent/src/server.py` re-checks the same ordering at import time, so a bad contract
fails the drift check *and* the image build.

The published CLI package contains only `lib/`, so it cannot load the repository
contract at runtime. It mirrors these values as literals and
`cli/test/constants-parity.test.ts` makes drift a CI failure. The standalone
Forge app is deployed outside the workspaces; it keeps a named copy of the
minimum length in `proxy.js`.

## Adding new constants

1. Add the key + nested object to `constants.json`.
2. Wire each consumer (Python, TS) to read the same key.
3. Update `scripts/check-types-sync.ts` (or successor drift check) to
   assert the new key is consumed where expected.
4. Bump this README's schema section.

Do not introduce new top-level literal declarations of the same
constant in code; the drift check exists to catch that.

## Lint enforcement (AI007, #258)

Inline magic numbers are caught by linters in all three packages:

- **TypeScript** — `@typescript-eslint/no-magic-numbers` in
  `cdk/eslint.config.mjs` and `cli/eslint.config.mjs` (blocking `error`).
- **Python** — ruff `PLR2004` (magic-value-comparison) in
  `agent/pyproject.toml` (blocking).

When one of these rules fires, name the value as a constant in the
owning module — or, if the value must agree across Python and
TypeScript, add it to `constants.json` and wire the consumers as
described above. The allowlists (0/1/-1, HTTP status codes, radix and
unit-conversion factors) live next to each rule's config.
