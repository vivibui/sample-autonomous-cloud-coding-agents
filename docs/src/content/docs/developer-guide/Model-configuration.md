title: Model configuration
---

**This is the canonical reference for which model the agent uses and where to change it.** The model ID is configured across five independent layers in three languages, so read this section before changing a default — a mismatch between the layers fails every task on the stack at turn 0, not just an edge case.

### The five layers

| # | Layer | What it controls | Where | ID form |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **IAM invoke allowlist** | Which models the agent's roles may invoke at all. The outer gate — everything below fails without it. | `DEFAULT_BEDROCK_MODEL_IDS` (`cdk/src/constructs/bedrock-models.ts:34`); override with CDK context `bedrockModels` (key at `:48`, resolver at `:67`) | **Bare** (`anthropic.claude-…`) |
| 2 | **Platform default model** | The model used when nothing narrower is set. A **Python literal only** — there is no CDK prop or environment knob in front of it today. | `agent/src/config.py:563` (the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` fallback) and `agent/src/models.py:157` (`TaskConfig.anthropic_model`) | Prefixed (`us.anthropic.…`) |
| 3 | **Auxiliary / fast model** | The small model Claude Code uses for auxiliary work (WebFetch page summarization, the pre-flight safety check). | Stack env `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` (`cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts` (the runtime environment block)); agent-side fallback at `agent/src/config.py:569` | Prefixed (`us.anthropic.…`) |
| 4 | **Per-repo override** | One repository's model, with no agent redeploy. | Blueprint `agent.modelId` (`cdk/src/constructs/blueprint.ts`, `BlueprintProps.agent.modelId`) → RepoTable `model_id` (`cdk/src/handlers/shared/repo-config.ts:37`) → ECS injects `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (`cdk/src/handlers/shared/strategies/ecs-strategy.ts:217`) | Prefixed (`us.anthropic.…`) |
| 5 | **Per-task / local** | One task's model. Payload `model_id` is aliased to `anthropic_model` (`agent/src/pipeline.py`, `_PAYLOAD_KEY_ALIASES`); local batch runs read `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` from the shell via `agent/run.sh`. | Task payload `model_id`; shell `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | Prefixed (`us.anthropic.…`) |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Who sets it | ID form | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | ECS strategy from the repo Blueprint (layer 4); you, in the shell, for local batch runs (layer 5) | Prefixed inference profile | The main coding model. Unset → the `agent/src/config.py` fallback. |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | The CDK stack, hardcoded at `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts` (the runtime environment block) | Prefixed inference profile | The small/fast auxiliary model. Must be a granted profile, or the pre-flight check times out with *"Pre-flight check is taking longer than expected"*. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` | The CDK stack (`='1'`) and `agent/run.sh` | — | Routes Claude Code to Bedrock instead of the Anthropic API. ABCA always runs on Bedrock. |

### Precedence — narrowest wins

```text
per-task payload model_id            (layer 5)
  > blueprint agent.modelId          (layer 4, arrives as stack env ANTHROPIC_MODEL)
  > stack env ANTHROPIC_MODEL        (layer 3-adjacent / local shell)
  > agent/src/config.py fallback     (layer 2 — us.anthropic.claude-opus-5)
```

Every one of those is gated by the **IAM invoke allowlist** (layer 1), which is itself gated by **account-level Bedrock model access**. Both gates are silent until invocation: a model that resolves fine through precedence still fails at turn 0 with `AccessDenied` if it is not in the grant list, and fails again if your account has not completed [Bedrock model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) for it.

### Bare vs. prefixed IDs — the one rule that bites

Layer 1 takes **bare foundation-model IDs**; every other layer takes the **prefixed inference-profile ID**. This asymmetry is deliberate: both grant sites derive the inference-profile ARN by *adding* the `us.` prefix themselves, so a prefixed entry in `bedrockModels` would produce an invalid `us.us.anthropic.…` ARN. The resolver rejects a `us.`/`eu.`/`apac.`-prefixed entry at `cdk/src/constructs/bedrock-models.ts:84` so the typo fails at synth rather than at runtime.

In the other direction, a **bare** ID cannot be invoked on demand at all. Verified:

```console
$ aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model --model-id anthropic.claude-opus-5 ...
ValidationException: Invocation of model ID anthropic.claude-opus-5 with on-demand
throughput isn't supported. Retry your request with the ID or ARN of an inference
profile that contains this model.
```

So: `bedrockModels` context → `anthropic.claude-opus-5`. Everywhere else → `us.anthropic.claude-opus-5`.

### Bumping the default model

1. Add the **bare** ID to `DEFAULT_BEDROCK_MODEL_IDS` (`cdk/src/constructs/bedrock-models.ts`) and deploy, so the grant exists before anything tries to use it.
2. Confirm account-level Bedrock access for the model in the target Region.
3. Update the **prefixed** ID in `agent/src/config.py` and `agent/src/models.py`.
4. **Verify the SDK price table recognizes the model.** The `max_budget_usd` guardrail is computed from a price table bundled into the Claude Agent SDK at build time, so an unrecognized model silently degrades budget enforcement. Run `agent/scripts/diagnostics/test_sdk_smoke.py` with `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` set to the new ID, divide the reported cost by the input-token count, and confirm the implied rate matches [published Bedrock pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/). A `$0.00` or wildly-off result means the table does not know the model and budgets cannot be trusted.
5. The doc-drift test (`cdk/test/contracts/model-default-docs-parity.test.ts`) fails until the documented defaults here and in `agent/README.md` match `config.py`. That failure is the reminder, not a nuisance — update both.

### Cost and model selection

Model choice is a **cost** decision, which is why it is adjustable per repo and per task without a code change.

**Per-token rate vs. token volume.** Measured on the pinned toolchain, same one-turn prompt, same system prompt:

| Model | Input tokens | Reported `cost_usd` | Implied input rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` | 32,145 | $0.160850 | **$5.00/MTok** |
| `us.anthropic.claude-opus-5` | 37,584 | $0.188020 | **$5.00/MTok** |

Token ratio 1.169; cost ratio 1.169 — identical. **The per-token rate is unchanged; the whole delta is token volume on an identical prompt.** Read it that way: "Opus 5 costs ~17% more per task" invites the wrong remedy (switch models), while "same rate, more tokens" points at the real levers — prompt size, prompt caching, and `max_turns`.

**Where can I set `max_budget_usd`?**

| Surface | How | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Per task, CLI | `bgagent submit --max-budget <dollars>` (`cli/src/commands/submit.ts:69`), range 0.01–100 | Works |
| Per task, REST | `max_budget_usd` in the `POST /v1/tasks` body | Works |
| Local batch only | `MAX_BUDGET_USD` shell env, when running `entrypoint.py` directly | Works locally; **ignored** by the deployed AgentCore **server** mode, which reads the budget from the `/invocations` JSON body |
| Per repo, Blueprint | `agent.maxBudgetUsd` on the repo's `Blueprint` construct | Works — persisted to `RepoTable.max_budget_usd`; same `0.01`–`100` range as the CLI, validated at CDK synth so an out-of-range value cannot deploy. See [Per-repo overrides](/sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents/customizing/per-repo-overrides). |
| Platform default | — | None by design: **unset means unlimited** |

**Per-task runtime budgets are unlimited by default.** Because no platform-wide per-task runtime ceiling applies, the documented mitigation for cost is choosing a lighter-token model rather than relying only on a cap:

- **Per repo:** Blueprint `agent.modelId` (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`) — no code change, no agent redeploy
- **Per task:** `model_id` in the task payload
- **Platform-wide:** the `bedrockModels` context plus the layer-2 call sites above

The model must be in the IAM grant list (layer 1) or the task fails at turn 0 with `AccessDenied` — the grant is the gate, so a lighter model is only reachable if it is granted.

**Trust boundary on the number.** `cost_usd` is the Claude Agent SDK's **client-side estimate** from that bundled price table — not authoritative billing. It drifts when Bedrock pricing changes, when the SDK version does not recognize a model, or when discounts and commitments apply. See [Cost attribution](/sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents/getting-started/cost-attribution) (the warning at line 6); authoritative cost comes from AWS Cost Explorer / CUR 2.0.

**Fleet monthly budgets are a separate admission control.** `bgagent budget set --user|--team --monthly-usd <amount> [--hard-stop]` stores a recurring user or Cognito-group limit. Terminal task costs roll up by UTC month from the TaskTable stream. The 80% and 100% crossings publish CloudWatch alarms; hard-stop scopes reject new task creation at 100% without terminating in-flight work.
