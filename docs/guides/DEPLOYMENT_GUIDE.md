# Deployment guide

This guide covers deploying ABCA into an AWS account, including compute backend choices, scale-to-zero characteristics, and the complete AWS service inventory. For day-to-day development workflow, see the [Developer guide](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md). For a quick first deployment, see the [Quick start](./QUICK_START.mdx). For least-privilege IAM deployment roles, see [DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md](../design/DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md).

## Architecture overview

ABCA deploys as a **single CDK stack** (`backgroundagent-dev`) containing all platform resources. The stack uses a `ComputeStrategy` interface to support three compute backends within the same stack:

| Aspect | AgentCore (default) | ECS Fargate (opt-in) | Lambda MicroVMs (experimental) |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Compute** | Bedrock AgentCore Runtime (Firecracker MicroVMs) | ECS Fargate containers | AWS Lambda MicroVMs |
| **Resources** | 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 2 GB max image size | 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM | 8 GB baseline / 32 GB peak memory |
| **Orchestration** | Durable Lambda (checkpoint/replay) | Same durable Lambda via `ComputeStrategy` | Same durable Lambda via `ComputeStrategy` |
| **Agent mode** | FastAPI server (HTTP invocation) | Batch (run-to-completion) | FastAPI server (lifecycle hooks) |
| **Startup** | ~10s (warm MicroVM) | ~60-180s (Fargate cold start) | ~6s to `RUNNING` (live-measured) |
| **Max duration** | 8 hours (AgentCore service limit) | 9 hours (orchestrator `executionTimeout`) | 8 hours (`maximumDurationInSeconds`) |

All backends are orchestrated by the same durable Lambda function. The `ComputeStrategy` interface abstracts `startSession()`, `pollSession()`, and `stopSession()` -- the ECS strategy calls `ecs:RunTask` / `ecs:DescribeTasks` / `ecs:StopTask` directly from the Lambda. No Step Functions are used.

ECS Fargate is currently **opt-in** -- the `EcsAgentCluster` construct is present in the stack code but commented out. To enable it, uncomment the ECS blocks in `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts`.

### Lambda MicroVMs backend (experimental)

> **Not for production.** `lambda-microvm` carries no smoke-parity guarantee for an unattended deployment. Keep production repositories on `agentcore` or `ecs`. Synth emits an unsuppressible warning to this effect whenever the backend is selected. Design detail: [COMPUTE.md](../design/COMPUTE.md) and [ADR-021](../decisions/ADR-021-lambda-microvms-compute-backend.md).

Selecting it is a synth-time context flag:

```bash
mise //cdk:deploy -- --context compute_type=lambda-microvm
```

**You must re-bootstrap first.** This is the single most common way this backend fails, and the failure does not look like a configuration problem:

1. Check the bootstrap policy bundle already deployed in the account:

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name CDKToolkit \
     --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='BootstrapPolicyVersion'].OutputValue | [0]" --output text
   ```

2. If it is **below 1.6.0**, re-bootstrap with the backend included in `ComputeTypes`. `cdk bootstrap` cannot pass template parameters, so the parameter goes on the `CDKToolkit` stack directly:

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy \
     --template-file cdk/bootstrap/bootstrap-template.yaml \
     --stack-name CDKToolkit --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
     --parameters ParameterKey=ComputeTypes,ParameterValue=agentcore\,lambda-microvm
   ```

   Bundle 1.6.0 adds the `MicrovmPassRoles` statement, without which the CDK-managed MicroVM image deploy fails with an `iam:PassRole` **AccessDenied on the build role** -- an IAM error that reads like a code bug. Rationale and the live evidence for the missing `iam:PassedToService` condition: [DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md](../design/DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md#iacrole-abca-compute-lambdamicrovms).

3. Regional availability is limited (5 Regions at launch). Synth fails fast with the supported list if the stack's Region is not among them; `bgagent doctor` probes it live.

Operational notes specific to this backend:

- **Nothing self-terminates.** A MicroVM whose task finished, crashed, or hung stays `RUNNING` and billing until the 8-hour cap. The orchestrator calls `TerminateMicrovm` on finalize, and the heartbeat-staleness check catches a hung guest inside a healthy VM -- but a leaked handle is a cost incident. The one exception: the service reaps a VM whose `/run` hook returns 4xx (~12s).
- **Logs** land in `/aws/lambda-microvms/<image-name>`. Guest stdout goes there too, which is the fallback path when the agent cannot reach the application log group.
- **Deployment identifiers are not baked into the image.** The snapshot carries no configuration; table names, secret ARNs, and the per-task session-role ARN arrive in the `/run` payload as a `platform_config` block. A version-skewed orchestrator that does not send it is refused rather than run with tenant scoping disabled.

### Optional Agent Registry

AWS Agent Registry is enabled by default. In an account or region where the preview service is unavailable or prohibited, omit the registry, its REST API, IAM grants, environment wiring, and stack outputs:

```bash
cdk deploy --context enableAgentRegistry=false
```

Blueprints without `registry://` asset references continue to work. A remaining registry reference fails task startup rather than silently skipping the asset.

The string form is case-sensitive: use lowercase `true` or `false`. Any other value fails synthesis with an actionable validation error.

This context is an infrastructure switch, not a pause control. Applying it to an existing enabled deployment deletes the CloudFormation-managed registry and its records; re-enabling creates an empty registry that must be republished. See [REGISTRY.md](../design/REGISTRY.md) for the catalog migration and runtime behavior.

## Scale-to-zero analysis

### Components that scale to zero (pay-per-use)

| Component | Billing Model | Idle Cost |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| DynamoDB (8 core tables; integrations add more) | PAY_PER_REQUEST | $0 |
| Lambda (all functions) | Per invocation | $0 |
| API Gateway REST | Per request | $0 |
| ECS Fargate tasks (when enabled) | Per running task | $0 (cluster is free) |
| AgentCore Runtime | Per session | $0 |
| Bedrock inference | Per token | $0 |
| AgentCore Memory | Proportional to usage | ~$0 |
| Cognito | Free tier (50K MAU) | $0 |

### Components that do not scale to zero (always-on)

| Component | Est. Monthly Idle Cost | Why |
|-----------|----------------------|-----|
| NAT Gateway (1x) | ~$32 | $0.045/hr fixed charge |
| VPC Interface Endpoints (7x, 2 AZs) | ~$102 | $0.01/hr × 7 endpoints × 2 AZs × 730 hrs |
| WAF v2 Web ACL | ~$5 | Base monthly charge |
| CloudWatch Dashboard | ~$3 | Per-dashboard charge |
| Secrets Manager (1+ secrets) | ~$0.40/secret | Per-secret monthly |
| CloudWatch Alarms | ~$0.10/alarm | Per standard alarm |
| CloudWatch Logs retention | ~$1-5 | Storage for retained logs |
| **Total always-on baseline** | **~$140-150/month** | |

The dominant idle cost is VPC networking: 7 interface endpoints across 2 AZs (~$102/month) plus the NAT Gateway (~$32/month).

For the full cost model including per-task costs, see [COST_MODEL.md](../design/COST_MODEL.md).

### Incremental cost-control cost

Monthly user/team controls add one DynamoDB on-demand table with PITR and three standard CloudWatch alarms. The table, API/Lambda reads, stream rollups, and SNS notifications are usage-based; the existing list Lambda and TaskTable reconciler perform the work, so there is no additional always-running compute.

At public US East (N. Virginia) first-tier list rates verified in August 2026, the three alarms are approximately $0.30/month total. The three possible custom metric series can add up to approximately $0.90/month when active. CloudWatch's account-wide free tier includes 10 custom metrics and 10 alarm metrics, so the incremental CloudWatch charge may be $0 when that allowance is still available. DynamoDB storage/PITR and request charges depend on task volume and the number of team scopes. See [Setting up cost controls](./COST_ATTRIBUTION.md#setting-up-cost-controls) for the operational overhead and pricing links.

## Reference

## CI/CD pipeline (`deploy.yml`)

The repository includes a two-stage CI/CD pipeline:

### Stage 1: Build (`build.yml`)

Triggers on every PR and push to main. Runs `mise run build` (compile, test, lint, synth) and uploads the synthesized `cdk.out/` as a `deploy-intent` artifact. The intent file declares whether a deploy should happen and for which compute types.

### Stage 2: Deploy (`deploy.yml`)

Triggers via `workflow_run` when `build.yml` completes successfully. The pipeline:

1. **Skips fork PRs** — `head_repository.full_name == github.repository` prevents forks from entering the deploy flow. This is a security measure: an untrusted fork could modify `build.yml` to produce a deploy-intent artifact, which would otherwise prompt maintainers for approval unnecessarily.
2. **Downloads `deploy-intent.json`** from the triggering build run.
3. **Resolves targets** — Determines which compute types to deploy:
   - `intent: "-"` → no-op (most PRs)
   - `intent: "labels"` → reads PR labels against an allowlist
   - `intent: "<type>"` → deploys the specified type (e.g., `agentcore`)
4. **Requires approval** — The `deploy` job uses a GitHub Environment with required reviewers. Approvals are logged and the self-review rule prevents unilateral deploys.
5. **Deploys via OIDC** — Assumes an IAM role via GitHub OIDC federation (no long-lived credentials). The role is scoped to the `cdk deploy` action with least-privilege policies per [DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md](../design/DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md).

### Security controls

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Fork exclusion (`head_repository` check) | Prevents fork PRs from triggering deploy approval prompts |
| Environment approval | Human gate before any deploy reaches AWS |
| OIDC federation | No stored AWS credentials; tokens are request-scoped |
| Compute type allowlist | Only pre-approved types can be deployed |
| Non-cancellable concurrency | Deploy can't be interrupted mid-flight |

### For administrators

- **Enable deploys**: Set the `deploy` Environment in repo settings with required reviewers.
- **Configure OIDC**: Set `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` secret and `AWS_REGION` variable.
- **Allowlist compute types**: Edit `ALLOWED_COMPUTE_TYPES` in `deploy.yml`.
- **Deploy via PR label**: Add the `deploy:<type>` label to a PR (e.g., `deploy:agentcore`).

## Known deployment issues

### AgentCore unsupported Availability Zones

**Affects:** Fresh deploys in accounts whose default Availability Zones don't line up with the zones AgentCore supports for the region.

**Symptom:** The `AWS::BedrockAgentCore::Runtime` resource fails to stabilize (`NotStabilized` — "subnets are in unsupported availability zones") and the stack rolls back.

**Root cause:** AgentCore Runtime only places its network interfaces in a subset of each region's Availability Zones, published as physical **zone IDs** (e.g. `use1-az1`, `use1-az2`, `use1-az4` for `us-east-1`). Zone IDs are stable across accounts, but zone *names* (`us-east-1a`) are aliased per-account — so `us-east-1a` can map to a different physical zone in your account than in another. Left to its default, CDK picks zones by name and can land the Runtime subnets in an unsupported zone. See the AWS [Supported Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agentcore-vpc.html#agentcore-supported-azs) table for the per-region set; the same table is snapshotted as `AGENTCORE_SUPPORTED_AZ_IDS` in `cdk/src/constructs/agentcore-azs.ts`.

#### Which deploy paths are protected

| Path | Auto-pinned? | What you must do |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| Local `cdk deploy` / `mise //cdk:deploy` (credentials resolve at synth) | Yes — for regions in the built-in map | Nothing, unless synth reports an `[AgentCore AZs]` error |
| CI/CD (`build.yml` → `deploy.yml`) | **No** — the assembly is synthesized credential-less | Set the `AGENTCORE_AVAILABILITY_ZONES` repo/environment variable (below) |
| Any region absent from the built-in map | No | Set the context override (below) |

**Auto-pin (local deploys).** With a concrete account and region, synth confirms the credentials belong to that account (`sts:GetCallerIdentity`), reads the account's zone name-to-ID mapping (`ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones`), and pins the VPC to the first two AZ *names* — sorted, so the pin is stable across synths — whose zone IDs are AgentCore-supported. Two zones matches `AgentVpc`'s default `maxAzs`, so enabling this does not widen an already-working topology.

If auto-pin is attempted and cannot finish — lookup denied or throttled, credentials pointing at a different account, or fewer than two supported zones — synth **fails** with an `[AgentCore AZs]` error rather than quietly falling back. That is deliberate: a silent fallback produces a template that looks pinned but is not, which is the failure this section exists to prevent. Fix the cause or set the override.

**CI/CD deploys are not auto-pinned.** Auto-pin needs a bound account at synth time and the pipeline has none: `build.yml` synthesizes `cdk.out` without credentials (env-agnostic) and `deploy.yml` deploys that pre-built assembly (`--app cdk/cdk.out`). Two consequences worth being explicit about:

- Passing `-c 'agentcore:availabilityZones=...'` to `cdk deploy` **has no effect on the pipeline path** — the template is already synthesized by then. Context only matters at synth.
- `cdk/cdk.context.json` is **not** a durable place to set this: it is gitignored, and `build.yml` regenerates the whole file.

Instead, set the repo (or environment) variable **`AGENTCORE_AVAILABILITY_ZONES`** to a JSON array of zone names. `build.yml`'s "Generate CDK context" step folds it into the context that the uploaded assembly is synthesized with, and an unset variable simply leaves the stack unpinned (synth logs an `[AgentCore AZs]` warning):

```
AGENTCORE_AVAILABILITY_ZONES = ["us-east-1b","us-east-1c"]
```

**Choosing the values.**

1. Discover your account's zone name-to-ID mapping:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region <region> \
     --query 'AvailabilityZones[].[ZoneName,ZoneId]' --output text
   ```
2. Pick at least two zone **names** (column 1) whose **zone IDs** (column 2) appear in the AgentCore-supported set for that region.
3. Set the value — the pipeline variable above, or for a local synth either `cdk/cdk.json` `context`:
   ```json
   { "context": { "agentcore:availabilityZones": ["us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"] } }
   ```
   or the CLI at synth time:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy -c 'agentcore:availabilityZones=["us-east-1b","us-east-1c"]'
   ```

The override is validated at synth time, and both the JSON-array and `-c` string forms behave identically. Synth fails with a message naming the key when the value is not an array, has an empty/non-string entry, lists fewer than two **distinct** zones, contains zone *IDs* instead of names (`use1-az2` — a common column mix-up), or names zones outside the target region. When the account's mapping is knowable, the override is additionally cross-checked against the supported set, and unsupported or nonexistent zones fail synth.

**Upgrading an existing stack.** Auto-pin is on by default, so a local `cdk deploy` against a stack created before this change may select different zones than the deployed subnets use. `Subnet.AvailabilityZone` is create-only, so that is a **replacement** of the subnets and the resources bound to them (route tables, NAT gateway/EIP, VPC endpoints). Run `mise //cdk:diff` first. If the diff shows subnet replacement and you would rather keep the current topology, pin the override to the zones already deployed:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=<vpc-id>" \
  --query 'Subnets[].[SubnetId,AvailabilityZone,AvailabilityZoneId]' --output text
```

Be aware that destroying a VPC whose subnets held AgentCore ENIs can take 20–40 minutes while AWS reclaims them (see the `DELETE_FAILED` note in the [quick start](./QUICK_START.mdx) troubleshooting table).

### DNS Query Log Config replacement cascade (upgrading from pre-v0.5)

**Affects:** Stacks deployed *before* the tag-exclusion fix ([#222](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents/pull/222)). Stacks created after this fix are not affected.

**Symptom:** `UPDATE_FAILED` on `AWS::Route53Resolver::ResolverQueryLoggingConfigAssociation` with error `InvalidRequest: Cannot create association — one already exists for this VPC`.

**Root cause:** The `ResolverQueryLoggingConfig` resource is *create-only* in CloudFormation — any property change (including Tags) triggers a full replacement. Pre-fix stacks have `github:sha` and other tags on this resource. Although the new code excludes it from future tag applications, CloudFormation still attempts to *remove* the now-excluded tags from the existing resource during the update, triggering the replacement cascade:

1. Config is replaced → new physical resource ID
2. Association detects `ResolverQueryLogConfigId` changed → triggers its own replacement
3. CloudFormation attempts Create-before-Delete on the association → Route53 Resolver rejects (one association per VPC) → `InvalidRequest`

**Resolution — choose one:**

#### Option A: AWS CLI disassociation (recommended)

Fastest, scriptable, no console access required. Replace `<vpc-id>` with the agent VPC ID and `<region>` with your stack's region.

1. List the association for your VPC to get the `ResolverQueryLogConfigId`:
   ```bash
   aws route53resolver list-resolver-query-log-config-associations \
     --region <region> \
     --query "ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations[?ResourceId=='<vpc-id>']"
   ```
2. Disassociate using the `Id` from step 1:
   ```bash
   aws route53resolver disassociate-resolver-query-log-config \
     --resolver-query-log-config-id <rqlc-id> \
     --resource-id <vpc-id> \
     --region <region>
   ```
3. Run `mise //cdk:deploy` — CloudFormation recreates both the config and association without the orphan tags. The pre-existing `ResolverQueryLoggingConfig` is replaced as part of the same update, so an explicit `delete-resolver-query-log-config` is not required.

#### Option B: Two-phase deploy (comment-out / re-add)

1. In `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts`, comment out the `DnsFirewall` construct instantiation (~line 197):
   ```typescript
   // new DnsFirewall(this, 'DnsFirewall', {
   //   vpc: agentVpc.vpc,
   //   additionalAllowedDomains: additionalDomains,
   //   observationMode: true,
   // });
   ```
2. Deploy: `mise //cdk:deploy` — this deletes the query log config, association, firewall rules, and related resources
3. Uncomment the `DnsFirewall` block
4. Deploy again: `mise //cdk:deploy` — resources are recreated cleanly without tags

Option B is more disruptive (two deploys, brief DNS logging gap) but requires no AWS API access beyond `cdk deploy`.

#### Option C: Manual disassociation via AWS Console

For users without AWS CLI access.

1. Open the [Route 53 Resolver console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53resolver/home#/query-logging)
2. Select the query logging configuration named `agent-dns-query-log`
3. Under **Associated VPCs**, disassociate the VPC
4. Delete the query logging configuration
5. Run `mise //cdk:deploy` (or `cdk deploy`) — CloudFormation will recreate both resources without tags
