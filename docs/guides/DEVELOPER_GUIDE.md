# Developer guide

This project is built in TypeScript with [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/), [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for tasks and tool versions, and AWS CDK for infrastructure. There is project-wide testing, code checks, and compilation. There is currently no dedicated development container, so you need to configure your local development environment by following the steps below.

![ABCA architecture](../imgs/abca-arch.png)

The repository is organized around four main pieces:

- **Agent runtime code** in Python under `agent/`  - runtime entrypoint, task execution loop, memory writes, observability hooks, and local container tooling.
- **Infrastructure as code** in AWS CDK under `cdk/src/`  - stacks, constructs, and handlers that define and deploy the platform on AWS.
- **Documentation site** under `docs/`  - source guides/design docs plus the generated Astro/Starlight documentation site.
- **CLI package** under `cli/`  - the `bgagent` command-line client used to authenticate, submit tasks, and inspect task status/events.
- **Claude Code plugin** under `docs/abca-plugin/`  - a [Claude Code plugin](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) with guided skills and agents for setup, deployment, task submission, and troubleshooting. See the [plugin README](../abca-plugin/README.md) for details.

> **Tip:** If you use Claude Code, run `claude --plugin-dir docs/abca-plugin` from the repo root. The plugin's `/setup` skill walks you through the entire setup process interactively.

## Where to make changes

Before editing, decide which part of the monorepo owns the behavior. This keeps API types, CLI, and docs in sync.

| Area | Paths | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|
| API & Lambdas | `cdk/src/handlers/`, `cdk/src/stacks/`, `cdk/src/constructs/` | Extend `cdk/test/` for the same feature. |
| API types | `cdk/src/handlers/shared/types.ts` and **`cli/src/types.ts`** | Update both when request/response shapes change. |
| CLI | `cli/src/`, `cli/test/` |  - |
| Agent runtime | `agent/` | Bundled into the image CDK deploys; run `mise run quality` in `agent/` or root build. |
| Docs (source) | `docs/guides/`, `docs/design/` | After edits, run **`mise //docs:sync`** or **`mise //docs:build`**. Do not edit `docs/src/content/docs/` directly. |

For a concise duplicate of this table, common pitfalls, and a CDK test file map, see **[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)** at the repo root (oriented toward automation-assisted contributors). Package-specific detail lives in **`AGENTS.md`** under `cdk/`, `cli/`, `agent/`, and `docs/`.

## Repository preparation

The [Quick Start](./QUICK_START.mdx) covers the basic setup: forking a sample repo, creating a PAT, registering a Blueprint, and storing the token in Secrets Manager. This section covers what you need beyond that.

### Pre-flight checks

After deployment, the orchestrator calls the GitHub API before starting each task to verify your token has enough privilege. This catches common mistakes (like a read-only PAT) before compute is consumed. If the check fails, the task transitions to `FAILED` with a clear reason like `INSUFFICIENT_GITHUB_REPO_PERMISSIONS` instead of failing deep inside the agent run.

Permission requirements vary by task type:

- `new_task` and `pr_iteration` require Contents (read/write) and Pull requests (read/write).
- `pr_review` only needs Triage or higher since it does not push branches.

Classic PATs with `repo` + `read:org` scopes also work and are required when fine-grained tokens cannot reach the target repo (collaborator access, cross-org repos). See [agent/README.md](../../agent/README.md#github-pat--minimal-permissions) for when to use which token type.

### Quick setup (single repo)

To point the default Blueprint at your own repo without editing code, pass it as a CDK context variable or environment variable:

```bash
# Context variable (preferred)
MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 mise //cdk:deploy -- -c blueprintRepo=your-org/your-repo

# Or environment variable
BLUEPRINT_REPO=your-org/your-repo MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 mise //cdk:deploy
```

The default is `awslabs/agent-plugins`. For a quick end-to-end test, fork that repo and pass your fork (e.g. `-c blueprintRepo=jane-doe/agent-plugins`).

### Multiple repositories

To onboard additional repositories, add more `Blueprint` constructs in `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts` and append them to the `blueprints` array (used to aggregate DNS egress allowlists):

```typescript
new Blueprint(this, 'MyServiceBlueprint', {
  repo: 'acme/my-service',
  repoTable: repoTable.table,
});
```

Each Blueprint supports per-repo overrides grouped into nested props (`BlueprintProps` in `cdk/src/constructs/blueprint.ts`):

```typescript
new Blueprint(this, 'MyServiceBlueprint', {
  repo: 'acme/my-service',
  repoTable: repoTable.table,
  compute: { runtimeArn: '...' },                    // override the default runtime ARN
  agent: {
    modelId: 'us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6',       // foundation model override
    maxTurns: 150,                                    // default turn limit for this repo
    systemPromptOverrides: 'Extra instructions...',   // appended to the platform prompt
  },
  credentials: { githubTokenSecretArn: '...' },       // per-repo GitHub token secret
  pipeline: {
    pollIntervalMs: 5000,                             // poll interval awaiting completion
    buildCommand: 'npm run build && npm test',        // build/test verification (default: mise run build)
    lintCommand: 'npm run lint',                      // lint verification (default: mise run lint)
  },
});
```

If you use a custom `compute.runtimeArn` or `credentials.githubTokenSecretArn`, pass the ARNs to `TaskOrchestrator` via `additionalRuntimeArns` and `additionalSecretArns` so the Lambda has IAM permission. See [Repo onboarding](../design/REPO_ONBOARDING.md) for the full model.

#### Build-regression gating (important for non-mise repos)

Before opening a PR, the agent runs a **build** and **lint** command in its cloud container — once on the clean clone (baseline) and again after its changes. If the build was green before and fails after, the task fails (a build-**regression** gate). This is a compile/test verification, **not** a deployment — your app's actual deploy stays in your own CI/CD after the PR merges.

The command defaults to **`mise run build`** / **`mise run lint`**. A repo that uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) with `build` / `lint` tasks gets gating for free. A repo that uses npm, gradle, cargo, make, etc. **must set `pipeline.buildCommand`** (and optionally `lintCommand`) to its real command — otherwise the default `mise run build` finds no task, **build-regression gating is silently OFF, and a change that breaks the build still reports success**. When that happens the agent surfaces a `⚠️ Build-regression gating is OFF` warning on the PR so the gap is visible, but the fix is to configure the command. For #247 orchestration this matters doubly: dependent sub-issues stack onto a predecessor's branch, so an unverified broken predecessor propagates downstream.

Redeploy after changing Blueprints: `mise //cdk:deploy`.

### Customizing the agent image

The default image (`agent/Dockerfile`) includes Python, Node 24 (LTS), `git`, `gh`, Claude Code CLI, and `mise`. If your repositories need additional runtimes (Java, Go, native libs), extend the Dockerfile. A normal `cdk deploy` rebuilds the image asset.

### Writing Cedar policies for the repo

A blueprint can declare its own `security.cedarPolicies` rules on top of the built-in hard/soft-deny starter set. Hard-deny rules absolutely block a tool call; soft-deny rules pause the agent and ask a human before proceeding.

See the [Cedar policy guide](./CEDAR_POLICY_GUIDE.md) for the full authoring reference — vocabulary (`execute_bash`, `write_file`, `context.command`, `context.file_path`), annotations (`@rule_id`, `@tier`, `@approval_timeout_s`, `@severity`, `@category`), worked examples, multi-match rules, and cross-engine parity testing with [`contracts/cedar-parity/`](../../contracts/cedar-parity/) fixtures.

### Other options

- **Stack name** - The default is `backgroundagent-dev` (set in `cdk/src/main.ts`). If you rename it, update all `--stack-name` references.
- **Making repos agent-friendly** - Add `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, and clear build commands. See the [Prompt guide](./PROMPT_GUIDE.md#repo-level-instructions) for details.

## Model configuration

**This is the canonical reference for which model the agent uses and where to change it.** The model ID is configured across five independent layers in three languages, so read this section before changing a default — a mismatch between the layers fails every task on the stack at turn 0, not just an edge case.

### The five layers

| # | Layer | What it controls | Where | ID form |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **IAM invoke allowlist** | Which models the agent's roles may invoke at all. The outer gate — everything below fails without it. | `DEFAULT_BEDROCK_MODEL_IDS` (`cdk/src/constructs/bedrock-models.ts:34`); override with CDK context `bedrockModels` (key at `:48`, resolver at `:67`) | **Bare** (`anthropic.claude-…`) |
| 2 | **Platform default model** | The model used when nothing narrower is set. A **Python literal only** — there is no CDK prop or environment knob in front of it today. | `agent/src/config.py:563` (the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` fallback) and `agent/src/models.py:157` (`TaskConfig.anthropic_model`) | Prefixed (`us.anthropic.…`) |
| 3 | **Auxiliary / fast model** | The small model Claude Code uses for auxiliary work (WebFetch page summarization, the pre-flight safety check). | Stack env `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` (`cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts` (the runtime environment block)); agent-side fallback at `agent/src/config.py:569` | Prefixed (`us.anthropic.…`) |
| 4 | **Per-repo override** | One repository's model, with no agent redeploy. | Blueprint `agent.modelId` (`cdk/src/constructs/blueprint.ts`, `BlueprintProps.agent.modelId`) → RepoTable `model_id` (`cdk/src/handlers/shared/repo-config.ts:37`) → ECS injects `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (`cdk/src/handlers/shared/strategies/ecs-strategy.ts:217`) | Prefixed (`us.anthropic.…`) |
| 5 | **Per-task / local** | One task's model. Payload `model_id` is aliased to `anthropic_model` (`agent/src/pipeline.py`, `_PAYLOAD_KEY_ALIASES`); local batch runs read `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` from the shell via `agent/run.sh`. | Task payload `model_id`; shell `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | Prefixed (`us.anthropic.…`) |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Who sets it | ID form | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | ECS strategy from the repo Blueprint (layer 4); you, in the shell, for local batch runs (layer 5) | Prefixed inference profile | The main coding model. Unset → the `agent/src/config.py` fallback. |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | The CDK stack, hardcoded at `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts` (the runtime environment block) | Prefixed inference profile | The small/fast auxiliary model. Must be a granted profile, or the pre-flight check times out with *"Pre-flight check is taking longer than expected"*. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` | The CDK stack (`='1'`) and `agent/run.sh` | — | Routes Claude Code to Bedrock instead of the Anthropic API. ABCA always runs on Bedrock. |

### Precedence — narrowest wins

```text
per-task payload model_id            (layer 5)
  > blueprint agent.modelId          (layer 4, arrives as stack env ANTHROPIC_MODEL)
  > stack env ANTHROPIC_MODEL        (layer 3-adjacent / local shell)
  > agent/src/config.py fallback     (layer 2 — us.anthropic.claude-opus-5)
```

Every one of those is gated by the **IAM invoke allowlist** (layer 1), which is itself gated by **account-level Bedrock model access**. Both gates are silent until invocation: a model that resolves fine through precedence still fails at turn 0 with `AccessDenied` if it is not in the grant list, and fails again if your account has not completed [Bedrock model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) for it.

### Bare vs. prefixed IDs — the one rule that bites

Layer 1 takes **bare foundation-model IDs**; every other layer takes the **prefixed inference-profile ID**. This asymmetry is deliberate: both grant sites derive the inference-profile ARN by *adding* the `us.` prefix themselves, so a prefixed entry in `bedrockModels` would produce an invalid `us.us.anthropic.…` ARN. The resolver rejects a `us.`/`eu.`/`apac.`-prefixed entry at `cdk/src/constructs/bedrock-models.ts:84` so the typo fails at synth rather than at runtime.

In the other direction, a **bare** ID cannot be invoked on demand at all. Verified:

```console
$ aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model --model-id anthropic.claude-opus-5 ...
ValidationException: Invocation of model ID anthropic.claude-opus-5 with on-demand
throughput isn't supported. Retry your request with the ID or ARN of an inference
profile that contains this model.
```

So: `bedrockModels` context → `anthropic.claude-opus-5`. Everywhere else → `us.anthropic.claude-opus-5`.

### Bumping the default model

1. Add the **bare** ID to `DEFAULT_BEDROCK_MODEL_IDS` (`cdk/src/constructs/bedrock-models.ts`) and deploy, so the grant exists before anything tries to use it.
2. Confirm account-level Bedrock access for the model in the target Region.
3. Update the **prefixed** ID in `agent/src/config.py` and `agent/src/models.py`.
4. **Verify the SDK price table recognizes the model.** The `max_budget_usd` guardrail is computed from a price table bundled into the Claude Agent SDK at build time, so an unrecognized model silently degrades budget enforcement. Run `agent/scripts/diagnostics/test_sdk_smoke.py` with `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` set to the new ID, divide the reported cost by the input-token count, and confirm the implied rate matches [published Bedrock pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/). A `$0.00` or wildly-off result means the table does not know the model and budgets cannot be trusted.
5. The doc-drift test (`cdk/test/contracts/model-default-docs-parity.test.ts`) fails until the documented defaults here and in `agent/README.md` match `config.py`. That failure is the reminder, not a nuisance — update both.

### Cost and model selection

Model choice is a **cost** decision, which is why it is adjustable per repo and per task without a code change.

**Per-token rate vs. token volume.** Measured on the pinned toolchain, same one-turn prompt, same system prompt:

| Model | Input tokens | Reported `cost_usd` | Implied input rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` | 32,145 | $0.160850 | **$5.00/MTok** |
| `us.anthropic.claude-opus-5` | 37,584 | $0.188020 | **$5.00/MTok** |

Token ratio 1.169; cost ratio 1.169 — identical. **The per-token rate is unchanged; the whole delta is token volume on an identical prompt.** Read it that way: "Opus 5 costs ~17% more per task" invites the wrong remedy (switch models), while "same rate, more tokens" points at the real levers — prompt size, prompt caching, and `max_turns`.

**Where can I set `max_budget_usd`?**

| Surface | How | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Per task, CLI | `bgagent submit --max-budget <dollars>` (`cli/src/commands/submit.ts:69`), range 0.01–100 | Works |
| Per task, REST | `max_budget_usd` in the `POST /v1/tasks` body | Works |
| Local batch only | `MAX_BUDGET_USD` shell env, when running `entrypoint.py` directly | Works locally; **ignored** by the deployed AgentCore **server** mode, which reads the budget from the `/invocations` JSON body |
| Per repo, Blueprint | `agent.maxBudgetUsd` on the repo's `Blueprint` construct | Works — persisted to `RepoTable.max_budget_usd`; same `0.01`–`100` range as the CLI, validated at CDK synth so an out-of-range value cannot deploy. See [Per-repo overrides](./USER_GUIDE.md#per-repo-overrides). |
| Platform default | — | None by design: **unset means unlimited** |

**Per-task runtime budgets are unlimited by default.** Because no platform-wide per-task runtime ceiling applies, the documented mitigation for cost is choosing a lighter-token model rather than relying only on a cap:

- **Per repo:** Blueprint `agent.modelId` (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`) — no code change, no agent redeploy
- **Per task:** `model_id` in the task payload
- **Platform-wide:** the `bedrockModels` context plus the layer-2 call sites above

The model must be in the IAM grant list (layer 1) or the task fails at turn 0 with `AccessDenied` — the grant is the gate, so a lighter model is only reachable if it is granted.

**Trust boundary on the number.** `cost_usd` is the Claude Agent SDK's **client-side estimate** from that bundled price table — not authoritative billing. It drifts when Bedrock pricing changes, when the SDK version does not recognize a model, or when discounts and commitments apply. See [Cost attribution](./COST_ATTRIBUTION.md) (the warning at line 6); authoritative cost comes from AWS Cost Explorer / CUR 2.0.

**Fleet monthly budgets are a separate admission control.** `bgagent budget set --user|--team --monthly-usd <amount> [--hard-stop]` stores a recurring user or Cognito-group limit. Terminal task costs roll up by UTC month from the TaskTable stream. The 80% and 100% crossings publish CloudWatch alarms; hard-stop scopes reject new task creation at 100% without terminating in-flight work. See [Monthly user and team budgets](./USER_GUIDE.md#monthly-user-and-team-budgets).

## Installation

Follow the [Quick Start](./QUICK_START.mdx) to clone, install, deploy, and submit your first task. It covers prerequisites, toolchain setup, deployment, PAT configuration, Cognito user creation, and a smoke test.

This section covers what the Quick Start does not: troubleshooting, local testing, and the development workflow.

### Troubleshooting mise

If `mise run install` fails or versions look wrong:

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `yarn: command not found` | Activate mise in your shell (`eval "$(mise activate zsh)"`), then `corepack enable && corepack prepare yarn@1.22.22 --activate`. |
| `node` is not v22 | Activate mise in your shell, then `mise install` from the repo root. |
| Mise errors about untrusted config | `mise trust` from the repo root, then `mise install` again. |
| `MISE_EXPERIMENTAL` required | `export MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` for namespaced tasks like `mise //cdk:build`. |

Minimal recovery sequence:

```bash
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"   # or bash; add permanently to your shell rc file
cd /path/to/sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents
mise trust && mise install
corepack enable && corepack prepare yarn@1.22.22 --activate
export MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1
mise run install
```

### Development workflow

Use this order to iterate quickly and catch issues early:

1. **Test Python agent code first** (fast feedback):

   ```bash
   cd agent && mise run quality && cd ..
   ```

2. **Test through the local Docker runtime** using `./agent/run.sh` (see Local testing below).
3. **Deploy with CDK** once local checks pass.

### Local testing

Before deploying, you can run the agent Docker container locally. The `agent/run.sh` script builds the image, resolves AWS credentials, and applies AgentCore-matching resource constraints (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM) so the local environment mirrors production.

The script validates AWS credentials before starting the Docker build, so problems like an expired SSO session surface immediately.

#### Setup

The `owner/repo` you pass must match an onboarded Blueprint and be a repository your `GITHUB_TOKEN` can push to and open PRs on.

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_..."     # Fine-grained PAT
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"     # Region where Bedrock models are enabled
```

The script resolves AWS credentials in priority order:

1. **Environment variables** - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and optionally `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` for temporary credentials.
2. **AWS CLI** - Runs `aws configure export-credentials` from your active profile or SSO session. Set `AWS_PROFILE` to target a specific profile.
3. **`~/.aws` mount** - Bind-mounts the directory read-only. Works for static credentials but not SSO tokens.

If none succeeds, the container starts without AWS credentials and any AWS API call will fail at runtime.

#### Running tasks

```bash
# Run against a GitHub issue
./agent/run.sh "owner/repo" 42

# Run with a text description
./agent/run.sh "owner/repo" "Add input validation to the /users POST endpoint"

# Issue + additional instructions
./agent/run.sh "owner/repo" 42 "Focus on the backend validation only"

# Dry run - validate config, fetch issue, print prompt, then exit
DRY_RUN=1 ./agent/run.sh "owner/repo" 42
```

The second argument is auto-detected: numeric values are issue numbers, anything else is a task description.

#### Server mode

In production, the container runs as a FastAPI server. You can test this locally:

```bash
# Start the server
./agent/run.sh --server "owner/repo"

# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:8080/ping

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":{"prompt":"Fix the login bug","repo_url":"owner/repo"}}'
```

#### Monitoring

The container runs with a fixed name (`bgagent-run`):

```bash
docker logs -f bgagent-run                        # live agent output
docker stats bgagent-run                          # CPU, memory usage
docker exec -it bgagent-run bash                  # shell into the container
```

#### Testing with progress events (DynamoDB Local)

By default, progress events and task state writes are silently skipped during local runs (the `TASK_EVENTS_TABLE_NAME` and `TASK_TABLE_NAME` env vars are not set). To enable them locally using DynamoDB Local:

```bash
# 1. Start DynamoDB Local and create tables
cd agent && mise run local:up

# 2. Run the agent with --local-events
./agent/run.sh --local-events "owner/repo" 42

# 4. In another terminal — query progress events
mise run local:events          # table format
mise run local:events:json     # JSON format

# 5. When done — tear down DynamoDB Local
mise run local:down
```

The `--local-events` flag connects the agent container to DynamoDB Local on the `agent-local` Docker network and sets the appropriate env vars. The agent code writes to DDB Local using the same code path as production — no mocks or alternate implementations.

#### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `us.anthropic.claude-opus-5` | Bedrock inference-profile ID for the main coding model |
| `MAX_TURNS` | `100` | Max agent turns before stopping |
| `MAX_BUDGET_USD` | | Cost ceiling for local batch runs only (production uses the API field) |
| `DRY_RUN` | | Set to `1` to validate and print prompt without running the agent |

For the full list, see `agent/README.md`. For how the model default is layered, overridden, and priced, see [Model configuration](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#model-configuration).

#### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ERROR: Failed to resolve AWS credentials via AWS CLI` | Run `aws sso login` if using SSO, or export `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` directly. |
| `ERROR: GITHUB_TOKEN is not set` | Export `GITHUB_TOKEN` with the required scopes. |
| `WARNING: No AWS credentials detected` | Configure one of the three credential methods above. |
| `WARNING: Image exceeds AgentCore 2 GB limit!` | Reduce dependencies or use multi-stage Docker build. |
| Bedrock / model errors in agent logs (e.g. model not available on your deployment, zero tokens) | IAM `grantInvoke` is not enough — account must meet [Bedrock model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) and use a supported [inference profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-use.html) ID in `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / task `model_id` where required | Complete Anthropic FTU and Marketplace prerequisites per the Bedrock User Guide; align `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts` grants with the chosen profile and Region |

### Deployment

Follow the [Quick Start](./QUICK_START.mdx) steps 3-6 for first-time deployment. For subsequent deploys after code changes:

```bash
mise run build
mise //cdk:deploy
```

A full deploy takes approximately 10 minutes. Expect variation by region and whether container layers are cached.

### Stack outputs

After deployment, the stack emits these outputs (retrieve with `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name backgroundagent-dev --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs' --output table`):

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `RuntimeArn` | AgentCore runtime ARN |
| `ApiUrl` | Task REST API base URL |
| `UserPoolId` / `AppClientId` | Cognito identifiers |
| `TaskTableName` | DynamoDB table for task state |
| `TaskEventsTableName` | DynamoDB table for audit events |
| `TaskNudgesTableName` | DynamoDB table for task nudges |
| `TaskApprovalsTableName` | DynamoDB table for Cedar HITL approval gates |
| `UserConcurrencyTableName` | DynamoDB table for per-user concurrency |
| `BudgetTableName` | DynamoDB table for recurring user/team limits and monthly estimated spend |
| `WebhookTableName` | DynamoDB table for webhook integrations |
| `RepoTableName` | DynamoDB table for per-repo Blueprint config |
| `CedarWasmLayerArn` | Lambda layer ARN for the Cedar WASM policy engine |
| `TraceArtifactsBucketName` | S3 bucket for agent trace artifacts (7-day lifecycle) |
| `GitHubTokenSecretArn` | Secrets Manager secret ARN for the GitHub PAT |
| `OperationalAlertsTopicArn` | SNS topic for DLQ and monthly-budget alarms |

When the Slack or Linear integrations are enabled, the stack emits additional outputs (e.g. `Slack*` and `Linear*` secret ARNs and integration table names).

Use the same AWS Region as your deployment. If `--region` is omitted, the CLI uses your default from `aws configure`.

## Project structure

The repository is a monorepo with four packages. Each one owns a piece of the platform and has its own build, tests, and mise tasks.

```
sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents/
├── cdk/          # Infrastructure and API (TypeScript, AWS CDK)
├── agent/        # Agent runtime (Python, Docker)
├── cli/          # CLI client (TypeScript, commander)
├── docs/         # Documentation site (Astro/Starlight)
├── mise.toml     # Monorepo task runner config
└── package.json  # Yarn workspace root
```

A task flows through these packages in order: the **CLI** (or webhook) sends a request to the **CDK**-deployed API, the orchestrator Lambda prepares the task and launches an **agent** session in an isolated compute environment, and the agent works autonomously until it opens a PR or the task ends. The **docs** package is independent and only affects the documentation site.

```mermaid

    CDK -->|launches session| Agent["agent/ (in compute env)"]
    Agent -->|opens PR| GH[GitHub]
```

Below is a task-oriented guide for each package: "I want to change X - where do I look?"

### `cdk/` - Infrastructure and API (TypeScript)

Everything that runs on AWS: the CDK stack, Lambda handlers, and DynamoDB table definitions. This is where most backend changes happen.

| I want to... | Look at |
|---|---|
| Add or change an API endpoint | `cdk/src/handlers/` for the Lambda, `cdk/src/constructs/task-api.ts` for the API Gateway wiring |
| Change task validation or admission | `cdk/src/handlers/shared/validation.ts`, `cdk/src/handlers/shared/create-task-core.ts` |
| Modify the orchestration flow | `cdk/src/handlers/orchestrate-task.ts`, `cdk/src/handlers/shared/orchestrator.ts` |
| Change how context is assembled for the agent | `cdk/src/handlers/shared/context-hydration.ts` |
| Add a DynamoDB table or modify a schema | `cdk/src/constructs/` (one construct per table) |
| Onboard repos or change Blueprint behavior | `cdk/src/constructs/blueprint.ts`, `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts` |
| Change webhook authentication | `cdk/src/handlers/webhook-authorizer.ts`, `cdk/src/handlers/webhook-create-task.ts` |
| Add or update tests | `cdk/test/` mirrors `cdk/src/` - each handler and construct has a colocated test file |

Key convention: API request/response types live in `cdk/src/handlers/shared/types.ts`. If you change them, also update `cli/src/types.ts` to keep the CLI in sync.

Build and test: `mise //cdk:build` (compile + lint + test + synth).

### `agent/` - Agent runtime (Python)

The code that runs inside the compute environment (AgentCore MicroVM). This is the agent itself: the execution loop, system prompts, tool configuration, memory writes, and the Docker image.

| I want to... | Look at |
|---|---|
| Change what the agent does during a task | `agent/src/pipeline.py` (execution flow), `agent/src/runner.py` (CLI invocation) |
| Modify system prompts | `agent/src/prompts/` - base template and per-workflow variants (`coding/new-task-v1`, `coding/pr-iteration-v1`, `coding/pr-review-v1`) |
| Change agent configuration or environment | `agent/src/config.py` |
| Add or modify hooks (pre/post execution) | `agent/src/hooks.py` |
| Change the Docker image (add runtimes, tools) | `agent/Dockerfile` |
| Run agent quality checks | `mise //agent:quality` (lint, type check, tests) |

Build and test: `mise //agent:quality`. The CDK build bundles the agent image, so agent changes are picked up by `mise run build`.

### `cli/` - CLI client (TypeScript)

The `bgagent` command-line tool. Authenticates via Cognito, calls the REST API, and formats output.

| I want to... | Look at |
|---|---|
| Add a new CLI command | `cli/src/commands/` (one file per command), `cli/src/bin/bgagent.ts` (program setup) |
| Change how the CLI calls the API | `cli/src/api-client.ts` |
| Modify authentication or token handling | `cli/src/auth.ts` |
| Update API types | `cli/src/types.ts` (must match `cdk/src/handlers/shared/types.ts`) |

Build and test: `mise //cli:build`.

### `docs/` - Documentation site (Astro/Starlight)

Source docs live in `docs/guides/` and `docs/design/`. The Starlight site under `docs/src/content/docs/` is generated - do not edit it directly.

| I want to... | Look at |
|---|---|
| Update a user-facing guide | `docs/guides/` (USER_GUIDE.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, QUICK_START.mdx, PROMPT_GUIDE.md) |
| Update an architecture doc | `docs/design/` |
| Change the sidebar or site config | `docs/astro.config.mjs` |
| Change how docs are synced | `docs/scripts/sync-starlight.mjs` |

After editing source docs, run `mise //docs:sync` or `mise //docs:build` to regenerate the site.

To validate that all cross-references are intact, run `mise //docs:link-check`. This checks all Markdown sources (`docs/guides/`, `docs/design/`, `docs/decisions/`, and root-level `.md` files) for broken internal (relative) links. The same check runs automatically in CI on every pull request, as part of the build's drift-prevention step. External `http(s)` URLs are deliberately not checked, so that network or bot-block flakiness cannot fail an unrelated PR.
